# MNIST k-NN Classifier 🖋️  

This project implements a **k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classifier** for the **MNIST dataset** using Python.  
The classifier is tested with different values of `k` and various training set sizes to evaluate its performance.

## 📌 Features  
- Implements **k-NN with L2 distance** for handwritten digit classification.  
- Evaluates model accuracy for **different values of k**.  
- Analyzes the impact of **training set size** on classification performance.  
- Uses **NumPy and SciPy** for efficient computation.  

## 📂 Project Structure  
- `Q2a.py` - Hoeffding Bound simulation.  
- `Q2b.py` - k-NN classifier implementation.  
- `Q2c.py` - Evaluates accuracy across multiple k values.  
- `Q2d.py` - Tests accuracy with varying training set sizes.  
- `docs/Assignment1.pdf` - The original assignment description.  
- `docs/Results.md` - Detailed results and analysis.  
- `docs/graphs/` - Contains accuracy plots for different experiments.
